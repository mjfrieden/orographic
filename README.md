# Orographic

Orographic is a new short-term options platform built from the useful parts of the prior weather systems, but with a much cleaner contract between signal generation, contract selection, portfolio construction, and presentation.

It is split into three first-party layers:

- `Scout`: a Cirrus-style symbol and direction engine. It decides whether a name has enough short-term edge to even deserve option-chain work.
- `Forge`: a Cumulus-style contract engine. It chooses the actual weekly contract and scores quote quality, breakeven burden, and payoff shape.
- `Council`: a Stratus-style portfolio gate. It selects the live board, keeps a shadow board, and enforces side concentration and diversification rules.

The game layer lives in `web/`. It is designed to deploy cleanly to Cloudflare Pages as a static site.

The protected access layer lives in `functions/` and runs as Cloudflare Pages Functions. It signs a short-lived session cookie and validates users from environment secrets, so the public repository never needs to store login credentials.

## Why this version is different

- No synthetic bid/ask fallback in the scan engine.
- One canonical snapshot schema from Scout to Forge to Council.
- Hard abstain support instead of forcing a pick.
- Live and shadow lanes are first-class from day one.
- Deployment path is intentionally cheap:
  - static game board on Cloudflare Pages
  - scheduled scan by GitHub Actions or a self-hosted runner
  - optional Worker later for lightweight API glue, not heavy scanning

## Local run

Create a venv and install dependencies:

```bash
cd /Users/mjfrieden/Desktop/2026/Orographic
python3 -m venv .venv
./.venv/bin/pip install -r engine/requirements.txt
```

Run a fresh scan:

```bash
./.venv/bin/python engine/run_scan.py --output web/data/latest_run.json
```

Preview the game board:

```bash
npx wrangler pages dev web
```

Then open the local Pages URL shown by Wrangler.

## Repo layout

- `engine/`: Python scan pipeline and tests
- `web/`: static game board for Cloudflare Pages
- `functions/`: Pages Functions for login, logout, session lookup, and admin gating
- `docs/`: architecture and deployment notes
- `.github/workflows/`: scheduled scan workflow
- `scripts/hash_auth_users.py`: helper to hash viewer/admin accounts for the `OROGRAPHIC_AUTH_USERS_JSON` secret

## Auth secrets

Orographic expects two Cloudflare Pages secrets:

- `OROGRAPHIC_SESSION_SECRET`: random signing secret for the session cookie
- `OROGRAPHIC_AUTH_USERS_JSON`: JSON array of hashed users with `username`, `role`, `salt`, `hash`, and `iterations`

Keep both in local ignored files or Cloudflare secrets only. Do not commit them to the public repository.

## Recommended free deployment

As of April 1, 2026, the default recommendation is:

1. Put the repo on GitHub.
2. Connect `web/` to Cloudflare Pages.
3. Let a scheduled GitHub Actions workflow write `web/data/latest_run.json`.
4. Let Cloudflare Pages redeploy on commit.

If you want $0 with a private repo, use a self-hosted GitHub runner on your machine instead of GitHub-hosted minutes.
